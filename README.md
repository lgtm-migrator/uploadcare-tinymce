This is a plugin for the [TinyMCE][tinymce] WYSIWYG HTML editor
providing it to work with [Uploadcare Widget][uc-feature-widget].

The plugin allows your users to upload files and images
from local devices, social networks, cloud storages, and more.
All that â€” without any backend code that is often required for uploads.

## Demo

Check out the basic demo [here][demo].

## Requirements

TinyMCE 4+.

## Install

Download the latest plugin archive from the [release branch][github-branch-release]
or [releases page][github-releases].

Extract the downloaded archive to the plugin directory of your TinyMCE
installation.

Other options here are either cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone -b release git@github.com:uploadcare/uploadcare-tinymce.git plugins/uploadcare
```

## Usage

Add `uploadcare` to the list of your TinyMCE plugins and the toolbar.
**Set your [public key][uc-docs-widget-options-public-key]**. Public keys are used
to identify a target Uploadcare [project][uc-projects] your uploads will go to.

```javascript
tinymce.init({
  selector: '#editor',
  plugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: 'uploadcare',
  external_plugins: {
    uploadcare: '/path/to/uploadcare/plugin.js',
  },
  uploadcare_public_key: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
})
```

## Configuration

### Plugin configuration

To apply a custom configuration, initialize the TinyMCE editor
providing additional options:

```javascript
tinymce.init({
  selector: '#editor',
  plugins: 'uploadcare',
  toolbar: 'uploadcare',
  external_plugins: {
    uploadcare: '/path/to/uploadcare/plugin.js',
  },
  uploadcare_public_key: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
  uploadcare_image_shrink: '500x375', // set client-size resize for images
  uploadcare_multiple: true, // allow multi-file uploads
  uploadcare_multiple_max: 3,
  uploadcare_crop: '1:1,4:3', // set crop options when handling images
  /* feel free to add more options here */
})
```

You can use any [widget options][uc-docs-widget-options]
that are allowed to use as object key. Just add the `uploadcare_` prefix and
use snake_case instead of camelCase for a name of an option, e.g.
`imagesOnly` &rarr; `uploadcare_images_only`.

### Widget configuration

Uploadcare Widget can be deeply customized to suit your UX/UI. You can define
allowed upload sources, implement file validation, and more.

Use our live [widget sandbox][uc-widget-configure] as a starting point and consider
checking out the docs on [widget configuration][uc-docs-widget-config] and its
[JavaScript API][uc-docs-widget-js-api].
